Hello! This is my spottieottie web application.

The main components of this project are a NodeJS server and an HTML website. 


Using the Spotify API, the website asks for the user's Spotify credentials, pulls their most listened to tracks over the past 4 weeks, and displays the track artwork in a 3x3 grid. The user can then click on each piece of art to play the track on the website.

The site works on both desktop and mobile, but it operates a little better on desktop.

The application may not work with all spotify usernames/emails yet, because it's in development mode and hasn't been granted an extension request by spotify. To have your spotify username or email added to work with the app, contact me at tiyiewuare777@gmail.com and let me know your spotify username or email address. Once it's added, the application should work for you!

The website URL: spotifynine.cyclic.app

Thanks!
